# CodeInno Task

Create a project that consists of two pages.
On the first page, there should be a restaurants list sorted by rate(on the backside) on the
left side and a map showing the restaurants on the right side.
While clicking on the single restaurant in the list, the map should show the clicked
restaurant in the middle.
While hovering on the restaurant in the map (Marker or custom icon), you should show
some tooltip, with restaurant info.
The second page is the restaurant page. By clicking on the restaurants both from the list
("View Restaurant" button) and the map it should navigate to a new page that shows
detailed information about the Restaurant, with ability to rate the restaurant and leave
feedback.
